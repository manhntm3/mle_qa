29. List a few favorite research papers. Why do you like them?
- CycleGAN paper
	https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593
	Top 1 must read paper. Very well-written and clear on the subject. The approach is impressive with a lot of visual content and real sample. High level of english language with many scientific terms.
- ResNet paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
Also very simple but deep and abstract. 
- BatchNormalization paper
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf
How the author organize topic is amazing. very intuitive but also strong and clear


So answer of this question really differ between people actually, and this is based solely on my experience. I usually read abstract, some work and some practical results. If it got me interested then I will dive deeply into the field, methods and comparison,... Personally, I will prefered well-written English scientific language with some meaningful math formula (not the hardcore ones) with some actual good results.
