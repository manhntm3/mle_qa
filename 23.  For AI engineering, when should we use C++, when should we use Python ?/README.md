23.  For AI engineering, when should we use C++, when should we use Python

C++ usecase:
- Run AI model with limited resources/time. C++ supports more efficient memory management and considerably faster
- Run model on embedded devices/mobile devices with focus on performance.

Python usecase:
- Design, build, train and evaluate models: Python supports many high-level library to address this.
- Quick experiment and demo an AI system. Python easy use and implement so it can be use in data analysis.
- When it is expensive to reimplement the algorithm in C++.

Put it simple: Python for development/experiment, C++ for production
