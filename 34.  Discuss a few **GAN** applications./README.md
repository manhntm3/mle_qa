GAN applications:

- Image-to-image translation
Image-to-image translation (I2I) aims to transfer images from a source domain to a target domain while preserving the content representations.
E.g: Translation from photograph to artistic painting style.
Translation of horse to zebra.
Note: Pix2pix, cycleGAN,...

- Text-to-Image Synthesis
Text-to-Image Synthesis (T2I) aims to produce an image that correctly reflects the meaning of a textual description.
Note: StackedGAN,  OP-GAN,...
- Data Augmentations
Use for generate data when dataset is small or lack of diversity in data(lighting conditions, environments,...)
