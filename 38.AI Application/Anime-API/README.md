# Animize Image Project

This project is inspired by a very simple idea, generate an anime version of a given arbitrary image uploaded by User.
Sample usage:
![Alt text](./sample/1.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](./sample/2.png?raw=true "Title")
Note: For simplicity, I used pretrained model I got from [here](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGANv2), which use [AnimeGANV2](https://tachibanayoshino.github.io/AnimeGANv2/) to perform image translation.

## Sample Usage

```bash
sudo bash prepare_server.sh
bash run_server.sh
```
