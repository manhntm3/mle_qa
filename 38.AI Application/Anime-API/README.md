# Animize Image Project

This project is very simple, generate an anime version of a given arbitrary image uploaded by User.
Sample usage:
![Alt text](./sample/1.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](./sample/2.png?raw=true "Title")
Note: For simplicity, I used pretrained model I got from [here](), which use [AnimeGANV2]() to perform image translation.

## Sample Usage

```bash
sudo bash prepare_server.sh
bash run_server.sh
```
