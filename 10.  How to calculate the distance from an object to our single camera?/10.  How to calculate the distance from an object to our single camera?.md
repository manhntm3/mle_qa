The ratio of the size of the object on the sensor and the size of the object in real life is the same as the ratio between the focal length and distance to the object.

If we have the info about the camera (focal length and sensor height) and the height of the object in real life, we can calculate the distance with a simple math formula:
distance to object = focal x real height x image height / (object height x sensor height)

If we don't have the info about the camera, we could sample a measurement of the distance for several time and inverse the formula to calculate the average focal length/ratio.

If we like to estimate the 3d surface of an object, we could try **Depth from focus/defocus**
